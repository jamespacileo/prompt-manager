# Best Practices

This guide outlines best practices for using the Prompt Manager effectively in your projects.

## Organizing Prompts

- Use meaningful category names to group related prompts.
- Keep prompt names descriptive and consistent.
- Use version control to track changes in your prompts.

## Writing Effective Prompts

- Keep prompts clear and concise.
- Use placeholders consistently (e.g., `{{parameter_name}}`).
- Include examples or context in the prompt description.

## Performance Optimization

- Initialize the PromptManager once and reuse the instance.
- Use the `listPrompts` method sparingly in production environments.
- Consider caching frequently used prompts in memory.

## Error Handling

- Always wrap PromptManager method calls in try-catch blocks.
- Implement proper error logging and reporting.

## Security Considerations

- Avoid storing sensitive information directly in prompts.
- Implement access controls if exposing prompt management via an API.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for your custom integrations with PromptManager.
- Create test prompts to validate your prompt processing logic.
